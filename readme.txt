=============
Installation
=============

Get good CDRs for your Dreamcast first !
Avoid Verbatim : 
I have personally wasted several of them and it was hit and miss.

Anything else that is not of cheap quality should be good.
(I'm personally using TDK and no issues so far)

Then, you need to burn the cdi file. (lastmission-dc.cdi)
I personally recommend ImgBurn, it also works on Wine btw.
If you don't know how, there should be a bunch of tutorials on the net to help you.
